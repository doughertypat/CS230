2.	Multi-process programming to duplicate one file into multiple files.

Write a C program to read the content of a text file (you create this file) and to write the content to multiple files. Your program must create one producer process and multiple consumer processes. The number of consumer processes is part of the command line argument of your program, which has to be no less than 2. The producer and multiple consumers share only ONE circular queue. The producer process reads the content of a text file to the shared circular queue. Each consumer process duplicates the content of the input text file to a separate output file. Each consumer process reads characters from the shared circular queue and writes the characters to a file that is opened by this consumer process. All processes have to terminate normally upon the completion of the duplication. Your program has to make it sure that the files generated by different consumer processes are identical to the input file that you have created. Your program has to produce the same number of output files (with identical content) as the number of consumers. The number of characters in your input file has to be at least twice of the full size of the shared circular queue.
